# Remote Worker Productivity Insights (Power BI Dashboard)

## üìä Overview  
This project analyzes remote worker behavior and performance using a dataset of 1,000 entries. The dashboard, built with **Power BI**, delivers key insights into task completion rates, tool usage, productivity scores by location and industry, and the effect of AI-assisted planning.

It provides stakeholders‚Äîsuch as HR professionals, team leads, and operational analysts‚Äîwith a data-driven view of workforce efficiency in remote settings.

---

##  Project Objectives
- Identify trends in remote worker productivity across industries
- Compare productivity scores by location type (city, town, village)
- Analyze AI-assisted planning adoption and its impact
- Track productivity variations by age
- Assess task completion rates and tool usage behavior

---

##  Dashboard Components, Observations & Recommendations

### 1. Average Productivity Score
- **Observation:** The average score across all remote workers is 39.08.
- **Recommendation:** Organizations can use this benchmark to flag underperforming teams and recognize high performers.

### 2. High Productivity Workers
- **Observation:** 333 workers were labeled ‚Äúhigh productivity.‚Äù
- **Recommendation:** Study their traits (location, industry, tool usage) to replicate success across teams.

### 3. Average Task Completion Rate
- **Observation:** Task completion rate stands at 81.26%.
- **Recommendation:** Generally positive, but room for improvement exists‚Äîespecially in low-productivity clusters.

### 4. Location-Based Productivity
- **Observation:** City-based workers showed higher productivity scores than village-based ones.
- **Recommendation:** Address digital infrastructure challenges in rural locations and increase engagement initiatives.

### 5. Industry-Based Insights
- **Observation:** Productivity is consistent across industries like IT, Healthcare, Retail, and Finance.
- **Recommendation:** Tailor remote work strategies by sector without assuming inherent advantages.

### 6. Tool Usage Frequency
- **Observation:** Workers use tools an average of 9.37 times per day.
- **Recommendation:** Identify whether tool usage leads to productivity or is a sign of over-reliance/burnout.

### 7. AI-Assisted Planning
- **Observation:** Only 49% of workers use AI tools for planning.
- **Recommendation:** Encourage AI adoption to automate routine scheduling and improve task execution.

### 8. Age vs Productivity
- **Observation:** A spike in productivity is seen around ages 30‚Äì35.
- **Recommendation:** Use this to inform team composition, mentorship, and growth plans.
